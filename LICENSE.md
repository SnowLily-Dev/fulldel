7. New Technology
   New Technology shall from here-on out be referred to as NT(7)
   The Corrupted Open Source License defines NT(7) under the following rules:
   A. Technological concepts still in active development.
   B. Software, hardware and other technology that is in its starting stages.
   C. LLMs, Machine Learning and related algorithms and programs.
   
   7a. Code using this license may be used to further modern technological developments given
   7ab. It is to not develop monetary gain.
   7ac. It is to be publicly available knowledge that the related contents and anything related by
        proxy of these contents was used in the development of the NT at hand.
   7ad. Given any structures such as, but not restricted to datasets contain any contents protected by this license
        the structures at hand are publicly available, distributed and easily accessible to the common citizen.
   7ae. 7ad must follow rules defined in (8).

8. The Common Citizen Transparency Rules
   The Common Citizen Transparency shall from here-on out be referred to as TCC(8).
   As defined in (7ad) and (7ae) the rules described as following under TCC(8) must be followed to ensure full
   transparency that can be found by any common citizen, not only those technologically more adept.

   8a. An official website associated directly with the NT(7) is obligatory.
   8b. The aforementioned NT(7)'s structures may be either directly on the landing page or on a different page
       entirely, given:
       8ba. There is a hyperlink directly accessible, unobstructed and intentionally noticeable by the commmon person
            to either the position of the structures on the page or the page in question.
       8bc. Zero obfuscation is permitted. Deliberate obfusciation of the transparency intended in NT(7) and TCC(8)
            will directly void and null this license.
   
   8c. Ensure annotation of more complex concepts such as - but not restricted to - Large Language Models and the workings thereof such as:
       8ca. A header describing to the reader in a commonly comprehensible manner of speech what is being shown to them.
       8cb. "Side note" paragraphs explaining complex details in finer, more comprehensible detail.
       8cc. Example: "The information collected from across the internet gets compiled into a program the robot can follow,
            the more information it has, the more it knows, the better it can provide it's services."
