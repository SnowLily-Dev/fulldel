   0a. "Structures" refers to any structure, construct, compilation, product or result of information of any kind protected under this license.
   0b. "Common persons" or "Common citizens" refers to any person, persons or groups of persons with basic levels of knowledge on complicated modern subjects, often
        referring to those who do not comprehend computers, computer sciences, technology and the Internet on a deeper level.
        The assumed understanding and knowledge of the common person tends to fall under "Knows how to open an application, does not know how the application functions
        under the hood".

7. New Technology
   New Technology shall from here-on out be referred to as NT(7)
   The Corrupted Open Source License defines NT(7) under the following rules:
   A. Technological concepts still in active development.
   B. Software, hardware and other technology that is in its starting stages.
   C. LLMs, Machine Learning and related algorithms and programs.
   
   7a. If you distribute a modified version that includes datasets directly derived from this software, those datasets must be distributed under this license.
       7ab. If redistributed as part of a commercial service, attribution must clearly state:
            7ab1. The usage of this license
            7ab2. The version of this license available at the time of distribution

   7b. Code using this license may be used to further modern technological developments given:
       7bb. It is to be publicly available knowledge that the related contents and anything related by
        proxy of these contents was used in the development of the NT at hand.
       7bc. Given any structures such as, but not restricted to datasets contain any contents protected by this license
            the structures at hand are publicly available without access fees or technical restrictions. 
       7bd. 7b is encouraged to follow the guidelines defined in (8).

8. The Common Citizen Accessibility Guidelines
   The Common Citizen Transparency shall from here-on out be referred to as TCC(8).
   As referenced in (7bd) the rules described as following under TCC(8) are recommended to ensure full
   transparency that can be found by any common citizen, not only those technologically more adept.
   The author encourages implementers to follow TCC(8) Accessibility Guidelines as a non-binding appendix.
   All provisions in Section 8 are recommended guidelines only and impose no legal obligations on licensees.

   8a. An official website or other form of publicly accessible medium associated directly with the NT(7) is obligatory.
   8b. The aforementioned NT(7)'s structures may be either directly on the landing page or on a different page
       entirely, given:
       8ba. There is a hyperlink directly accessible, unobstructed and intentionally noticeable by the common person
            to either the position of the structures on the page or the page in question.
            8ba1. The page must contain an "accessibility toolbar", clearly visible and consistently at the top, bottom, left or right edge of the page.
                  This shall be referred to from here-on out as "toolbar".
            8ba2. The toolbar must provide a clearly accessible button that changes the page's font to a "dyslexia friendly" font, such as OpenDyslexic
            8ba3. The toolbar must provide a clearly accessible button that activates a text-to-speech based or narrated page reader.
                  8ba3a. This button must expand a user interface within the toolbar containing a clearly visible pause/play button, a drop down menu providing speed
                         settings for the reader and a volume slider for the reader.

       8bc. Zero obfuscation. Ensure the common person can always easily understand and access the page(s).
       8bd. Other forms of a publicly accessible medium must always have a text form variant to be referred to.
            8bda. "Other forms" are defined as following:
                   8bda1. Video format
                   8bda2. Audio format
                   8bda3. Video and Audio (commonly known as "AV") format
       8be. Any format must be accessible to any and all common persons, accommodation for disabilities such as - but not restricted to - dyslexics, the hard of
            hearing, the hard of sight, etc.
       8bf. Accommodations must consist of the following:
             8bf1. Video formats contain clearly legible Closed Captions and accessible amplification for those hard of hearing.
                    8bf1a. For dyslexic accommodation specialized fonts are obligatory to be provided as a clearly visible option to the common person(s).
                    8bf1b. For the hard of hearing accommodation must be a clearly visible, unobstructed button to amplify the audio to their needs.
                           8bf1ba. Aforementioned "button" must inquire a secondary confirmation through a "yes or no" dialogue box, warning the person(s) of possible
                                   hearing damage and defining the use case as follows:
                                   8bf1baa. "Amplify sound for hard of hearing?"
                                   8bf1bab. "Warning: This is intended for those hard of hearing and may cause damage to those not in need of this accommodation."
             8bf2. Audio formats must contain (8bf1b)

   8c. Ensure annotation of more complex concepts such as - but not restricted to - Large Language Models and the workings thereof such as:
       8ca. A header describing to the reader in a commonly comprehensible manner of speech what is being shown to them.
       8cb. "Side note" paragraphs explaining complex details in finer, more comprehensible detail.
       8cc. Example: "The information collected from across the internet gets compiled into a program the robot can follow,
            the more information it has, the more it knows, the better it can provide its services."
